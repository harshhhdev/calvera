# Getting started

So, first clone this repo to your files

```bash
git clone https://harshhhdev.github.io/calvera

# Go into the directory
cd calvera
```

Then, we need to install the needed packages. For this project, I used [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/), but feel free to use other package managers like [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) or [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/)

```bash
yarn

# If using NPM
# npm i
```

Let's now start our Abell Development Server.

```bash
yarn dev

# If using NPM
# npm run dev
```

Awesome! Your website should now be running at [localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000/)

Now, if you make an edit to your file, you can see the website in your browser automatically refreshes. Cool!

# Customising

The customisation in this blog has been simplified to just a simple JavaScript file.

Open the `abell.config.js` file, and start filling in fields with what your information!
